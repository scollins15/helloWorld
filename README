This is a test file...I am going to try and commit this to the repository
	you do have to add the file to the commit log again after changes are made.  For example sudo git add README
	you do not have to run the repository location again.  For example sudo git remote add origin git.......
	you do have to push the changes for the commit to take effect.  You should also first add a message to the commit to track the changes.
